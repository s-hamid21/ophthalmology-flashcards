# ophthalmology-flashcards
Ophthalmology flashcard questions tailored towards UK medical students in their clinical years. This set of flashcards can be subdivided into subspeciality-specific content (e.g. such as cornea, glaucoma, acute eye); you can also create your own flashcards to add to the deck and customise using our tags filter!
